# PutDownMyMac--an app to prevent someone take your macbook

## 制作初衷
> 我自己经常在咖啡厅使用电脑码字或者看期货交易，经常人有三急需要离开电脑，电脑放桌上又有点不放心，全部装包里带去上厕所又嫌麻烦，于是想到了做一个报警的app。

## 使用方法
> 使用很简单，电脑插入电源，打开软件，打开alert功能。如果有人把电源拔掉，程序就会发出警报音直到重新插入电源。如果不是外放而是使用的耳机，则可以提醒你自己，如果使用了外放，则会让周围的人关注到你电脑这个方向。

## Contributing
> 练手的小成品，看在开发过程中无数次插拔电源，希望大家多多star。也欢迎大家多多contributing或者提意见。


## Purpose of this app
> I use my mac in coffee shop a lot. When I want to go to restroom, It's not so safe to put my mac on table, also it's a lot trouble to put my mac in bag and bring the bag with me. So I think about making an app to prevent others take my mac.

## How to use
> It's very simple actually. Plug in the AC, turn on the alert. If someone unplug the power and try to take your mac away, the app will try to play Alarm sound.Be sure to disconnect your wireless headset so that other people in coffee shop will notice someone is taking you mac away.
